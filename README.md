# OptiGreat 11
For me Windows, in contrast to Linux, can't be used out of the box. 
It's too slow, privacy-invasive and bloated. 
The first thing I do on a fresh Windows install is optimizing
the whole system (and what I mean by that is deleting bloatware,
improving privacy, tweaking settings and replacing the default
heavy apps). 

I've always done it from memory, but
recently I thought it would be a great idea to turn this into
a program that could automate it - that's how OptiGreat was made.
I know it's not perfect, it has bugs, it's UI isn't always 
consistent (actually that's a Windows reference :) /s), but
it's just a fun hobby project I made, nonetheless, I'll
try to improve it and make it as efficient as possible.

So if you want to make your Windows 10/11 faster, more private,
more secure and less resource-heavy, feel free to use OptiGreat! :)
