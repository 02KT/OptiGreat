# [DISCONTINUED!]
Because I switched to Linux some time ago, I have no motivation to continue working on OptiGreat. 
Some additional features* might not work correctly or might not be implemented.

**But because of OptiGreat's open-source nature, I encourage you to fork my project and update it to support latest Windows versions!**


_*As OptiGreat relays mostly on third-party tools, the core functionality should be working correctly forever. When I'll upload the final release, I'll try to delete all non-working or unfinished features to make sure the program stays functional._

# OptiGreat 11
OptiGreat is a program created to make Windows install faster, more privacy-respecting and much more secure for everyone. 
Gamers will appreciate lowered usage of RAM, CPU and disk usage, privacy-enthusiasts may enjoy having a little less privacy-invasive system, and any casual user will notice the boost in speed.

# Features
It has some features I haven't seen in other popular debloating tools:
 - Uninstalling Chromium Edge
 - Uninstalling Cortana
 - Disabling Defender
 - Disabling Optional Features
 - Disabling User Account Control

And many others:
- Disabling telemetry
- Changing your default drive if you have more drives to help you save space and lower the risk of losing data
- Replacing default apps with lighter and (mostly) open-source alternatives (Nana-Zip for managing archives, Photos > IrfanView64, Movies & TV -> VLC, BCUninstaller for uninstalling programs, NVCleanstall -> GeForce Experience...)
- Changing folder settings for security and speed (Showing file extensions, disabling ads in Explorer...)
 AND MORE!!!
 
 # Why OptiGreat?
 I've used many debloating scripts on my computers.
 I haven't found a single script that doesn't destroy Windows (e.g. non-working Store or broken Explorer) while also making a significant difference in performance.
 
 My main focus with OptiGreat was to make **the most effective Windows speed-up tool without sacrificing stability** - Windows remains 100% functional after the process!
 
So if you want to make your Windows 11 faster, more private,
more secure and less resource-heavy, feel free to use OptiGreat! :)

# Does OptiGreat work on Windows 10?
As Windows 11 is just an another layer of new features over Windows 10, OptiGreat should work there as well but I can't guarantee it (I don't have the time to maintain compability for multiple OSes so I tested it only on Windows 11 machines).

# Credits
Show support by donating to many programs used with OptiGreat like 7-Zip, Nana-Zip, VLC or LibreOffice! People behind them work really hard to make sure you have the best experience using their projects!

The whole program is written by myself but it downloads and uses a lot of third-party tools.
